MULTITHREADING 
what is multi threading ?
if you want to do multiple task in same time and same data we can used threading.
ex:multiple tab ,process

WHY WE USE THREADING:

this method is a faster and more efficient way to create new threads.
Parallel Computation: the thread can allow doing parallel processing with the goal of an increase in processing speed.
standaration: it is become standaration apporach for all standaration .it is used for to increasing programming the speed

consumaption:
parallel i/O:

t1.run():it is act as the entry of the thread.
t1.start():it is used for starting the threading by calling the run().
To start a process, we use start method of Process class.
t1.join() method is tells to main wait for the excutaion process complete.
Once the processes start, the current program also keeps on executing. In order to stop execution of current program until a process is complete, we use join method.
